# FreeCycle

This application is for second-hand donations for studentsâ€™ needs. The application aims to provide easy access to the belongings of the students when
they rent a new house. After they graduate, students leave their houses and
sell their belongings or give them to their friends because they mostly want
to get rid of their belongings. This app makes it easy for them to get rid
of their belongings because other students can get the belongings out of their
house by getting donations. Also, everyone can donate to students by uploading their unwanted belongings to the application. Every student can receive
donations after profile confirmation with student ID and people can not donate valuable belongings to avoid it turning into a business. It is similar to
many second-hand applications today. This application, unlike the others,
allows items to be donated. So people who post their stuff on the app have
no intention of making money. In this way, students who need the item can
agree with the person who advertises here and become the new owner of the
item without paying any money. This application not only helps students but
also contributes to recycling.
